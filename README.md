## Introduction

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predictive analysis. It finds the best linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This repository provides a clear and concise implementation of both simple and multiple linear regression, focusing on understandability and practical application.

## Features

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Implementation for single independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Implementation for multiple independent variables.
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):** Uses the analytical solution for finding optimal coefficients.
- **Gradient Descent (Optional/Planned):** (Consider adding if you plan to implement this in the future, otherwise remove.)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes common metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Clear Codebase:** Well-commented and easy-to-understand code.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Basic preprocessing steps if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).
- **Visualization:** Basic plotting capabilities for understanding the regression line/plane.

## Dependencies:

pandas

scikit-learn (for comparison/utility functions, not for core model implementation)

matplotlib

## Mathematical Background
Linear Regression aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more independent variables X by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

### Simple Linear Regression
For a single independent variable, the equation is:
y=
beta_0+
beta_1x_1+
epsilon
Where:

y is the dependent variable.

x_1 is the independent variable.

beta_0 is the y-intercept.

beta_1 is the slope coefficient.

epsilon is the error term.

The coefficients 
beta_0 and 
beta_1 are determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, known as the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.

### Multiple Linear Regression
For multiple independent variables, the equation extends to:
y=
beta_0+
beta_1x_1+
beta_2x_2+
dots+
beta_nx_n+
epsilon
In matrix form:
Y=X
beta+
epsilon

The OLS solution for 
beta is given by:
hatbeta=(X 
T
 X) 
âˆ’1
 X 
T
 Y
