## Introduction

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predictive analysis. It finds the best linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. This repository provides a clear and concise implementation of both simple and multiple linear regression, focusing on understandability and practical application.

## Features

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Implementation for single independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Implementation for multiple independent variables.
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):** Uses the analytical solution for finding optimal coefficients.
- **Gradient Descent (Optional/Planned):** (Consider adding if you plan to implement this in the future, otherwise remove.)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes common metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Clear Codebase:** Well-commented and easy-to-understand code.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Basic preprocessing steps if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).
- **Visualization:** Basic plotting capabilities for understanding the regression line/plane.
